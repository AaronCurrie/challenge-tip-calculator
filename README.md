## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### Why I built this project
My main goals for building this project were to practice building a fully interactive web app for the first time. 

I used my knowledge of html and CSS to style the app.

This was a great chance to put into use what I have recently learnt regarding JS and the DOM.
